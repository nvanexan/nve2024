- Continued work on the modernization of a student loan application for a Canadian provincial government. The project is a .NET&nbsp;[Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)&nbsp;server application, so I've been continuing my journey in building UI in&nbsp;[C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/).
- A very busy month socially. Visits with my parents, my partner's parents, my sister's family and a bunch of close friends.
- Attended a couple of my nephew's soccer games. Amazing to see the progression.
- Went to the Art Gallery of Ontario to check out the [KAWS:Family](https://ago.ca/exhibitions/keith-haring-art-everybody) and [Keith Haring](https://ago.ca/exhibitions/keith-haring-art-everybody) exhibits. Delicious, both of them.
- These were [the songs in my rotation in January](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1gW70qezBTt1s3eTMURn6v?si=d6d1dda6f2bb476d). A [Way Forward by Nation of Language](https://open.spotify.com/album/2hPnsq6HZHcgkFlLclKrvv?si=BuAUZ8TuTNaa8XIwj59CMg) is an eminently listenable album.

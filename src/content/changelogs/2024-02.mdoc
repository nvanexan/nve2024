- It was a busy month of work. I continue work on the modernization of a student loan application system for a Canadian provincial government. The project is a .NET [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) server application, so I've been continuing my journey in building UI in [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/).
- I wrote a [blog post](https://nick.vanexan.ca/posts/blazor-a-review-and-primer-for-ui-devs) about my experience with [Blazor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-8.0) so far. TLDR: it's pretty good, also I still miss JS ðŸ˜„.
- I migrated my website to Astro, and wrote another [blog post](https://nick.vanexan.ca/posts/astro-keystatic-markdoc) about my experience with [Astro](https://astro.build/) + [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/) + [Keystatic](https://keystatic.com/)
- I got to see [Brittany Howard](https://www.brittanyhoward.com/) at the [Danforth Music Hall](https://thedanforth.com/) thanks to our amazing friend Cody.
- Finished final scheming on birthday plans for my partner next month ðŸ¤«
- These were [the songs in my rotation in February](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7pwfXHRgI7YhI3SYEFPhWp?si=f3be0172340f468e).

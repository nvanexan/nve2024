- Started work for a new client, a publicly traded provider of human resources software. I'm working to help make their aging [Dojo](https://dojotoolkit.org/) / [React](https://reactjs.org/) codebase accessible to [WCAG Level AA spec](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance). It's not sexy work, but I like the idea that I'm enabling human rights.
- Continued embedded work with another client who lost their lead privacy engineer. Currently assisting with the privacy design for a data warehouse in [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/).
- Started studying for the [CIPT certification](https://iapp.org/certify/cipt/). I don't love certification schemes, but it seems a good way to refine and document my knowledge in this space.
- Started going to the gym again, and doing strength training to improve my back. It has been really helpful with my day-to-day.
- These are [the songs that carried me through February](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5udMNSYCeBkA1hvTTPxUbZ?si=e03b6d864a2042d7).

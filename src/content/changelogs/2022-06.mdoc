- Continued UI / accessibility engineering work for a publicly traded provider of human resources software.
- On the privacy side, I spent some time consulting on the fallout of the [CNIL decision re Google Analytics](https://www.cnil.fr/en/use-google-analytics-and-data-transfers-united-states-cnil-orders-website-manageroperator-comply).
- Visited my parents for the first time in almost a year, and watched my dad's band play a car show in the middle of nowhere - he's 74 and still slapping the bass ðŸ˜„.
- Set up a new [raspberrypi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) at home, running [openvscode-server](https://github.com/gitpod-io/openvscode-server) to give me a personal "Codespace", secured with [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/).
- Finished watching [Station Eleven](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10574236/) - a difficult but also beautiful show; [Himesh Patel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himesh_Patel) should win an emmy - he gives a tour de force performance imho.
- Started re-watching [Halt and Catch Fire](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543312/) - a show about failure and feeling good lost - themes I'm working more with myself lately.
- Got a new tattoo by [Jack Candlish](https://www.instagram.com/jwcandlish/), a Toronto artist currently at [Archive](http://www.archivetattoo.com/) whose work I admire.
- These are [the songs that carried me through June](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/280xIdRBc2EMAoYBtrMVyn?si=2f901d8f98f9416c).

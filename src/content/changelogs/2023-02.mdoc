- Continued accessibility (a11y) development work for a publicly traded HR SaaS company. 
- Gave a presentation on micro frontend (MFE) architecture and design systems. I put some of my thoughts on these topics for large organizations in a post [here](https://nick.vanexan.ca/posts/micro-frontends).
- Wrote a second [blog post about Web Components](https://nick.vanexan.ca/posts/web-components), on new developments in ergonomics and SSR.
- Updated the [RSS feed](https://nick.vanexan.ca/feed.xml) of my site to include blog post entries.
- Wrote a new Table of Contents web component for the [blog pages](https://nick.vanexan.ca/writing) on my site.
- Saw the [Toronto Jazz Orchestra](https://thetjo.com/) perform a night of Radiohead at 3030 Dundas as part of Hugh's Room Live show. They were, as usual, fantastic.
- I finally found a [guitar](https://www.fender.com/en-US/40th-anniversary-stratocaster-vintage-edition/0379510572.html) of my own, and this month started learning Autumn Leaves, a jazz standard.
- These are [the songs that carried me through February](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0Y3d7bM5xMRwqZtKkOHi3p?si=bbe2c5a65f99432e).

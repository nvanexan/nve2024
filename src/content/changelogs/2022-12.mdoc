- Continued UI / accessibility engineering work for a publicly traded HR software company, and some work on cookie policy updates for another global SaaS provider.
- Attended a small workshop on [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components), and did some deep diving into algorithms and data structures (linked lists, bubble sorts, etc.) for some continuing professional development.
- Kitted out my .vimrc with some new plugins for writing. If you're interested in using vim for writing prose, check out [vim-pencil](https://github.com/preservim/vim-pencil) and [goyo.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim)
- Continued my journey into learning the guitar with some lessons on the [Circle of Fourths](https://deftdigits.com/2012/01/30/how-to-memorize-and-use-the-cycle-of-fourths/) and 6-2-5-1 chord progressions. Still looking for a decent used electric guitar.
- Hosted our family for Boxing Day Christmas Brunch and went to a bunch of holiday parties. Big change from the last two years of Covid Christmases. Enjoyable but also exhausting for this introvert.
- These are [the songs that carried me through December](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7rLiZKKEr9AeZ8YzrBCQQV?si=8f69179d233f4f42).
- All my 2022 playlist songs combined into [one year-end playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1IsEP1y5qNEtDNzzcuOSlv?si=dcc9b9575ffb4615).

That's a wrap on 2022 for me. Wishing you all the very best in 2023!

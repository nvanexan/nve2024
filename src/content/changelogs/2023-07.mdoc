- Finished my contract work leading UI / feature development of a micro frontend for a publicly traded HR SaaS platform. Helped my team get their MVP HR ticketing solution shipped and out the door for customer feedback, complete with documentation and knowledge transfer for the UI devs I helped hire. With that, my contract has come to an end. I'm planning on taking some time off in August to reboot and fix some things around the house, and look forward to building more fun things in September!
- Attended a large family BBQ at my dad's in Bobcaygeon.
- These were [the songs that carried me through July](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3SQBEk7RQK67tEQOjo7AWT?si=8bef39ec644b4f4c).

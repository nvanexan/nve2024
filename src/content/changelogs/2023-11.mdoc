- Continued work on the modernization of a student loan application for a ==Canadian provincial government==. The project is a .NET&nbsp;[Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)&nbsp;server application, so I've been continuing my journey in building UI in&nbsp;[C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/).
- Travelled to Chile for 10 days with my partner. We travelled to Punta Arenas and saw penguins on&nbsp;[Magdalena Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalena_Island,_Magallanes_Region); to Puerto Natales and day-hiked in&nbsp;[Torres del Paine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_del_Paine_National_Park)&nbsp;park (incl. the Mirador Las Torres hike); to San Pedro de Atacama and saw the&nbsp;[Valle de la Luna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valle_de_la_Luna_\(Chile\)), the&nbsp;[El Tatio Geysers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Tatio)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[Laguna Cejar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salar_de_Atacama); and to Santiago where we enjoyed the city and nearby&nbsp;[Valpara√≠so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valpara%C3%ADso). I'm hoping over the holidays to write a few longer-form posts about our experience.

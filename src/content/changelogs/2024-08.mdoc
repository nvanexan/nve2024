- I continue work on the modernization of a student loan application for a Canadian provincial government. The project is a .NET&nbsp;[Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)&nbsp;server application, so I've been continuing my journey working full stack in&nbsp;[C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/).&nbsp;
- Celebrated my in-laws' 50th wedding anniversary, and our own 10th wedding anniversary.
- Celebrated my best friend's 40th birthday with a nice dinner at [Grey Gardens](https://greygardens.ca/), a gem of a restaurant tucked away in [Kensington Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Market).
- Celebrated my dad and niece's birthdays (a lot of celebrations this month!)
- Spent some time in the [Kawartha Lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawartha_Lakes) region visiting my parents.
- Started reading&nbsp;[A Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39996759-a-philosophy-of-software-design)&nbsp;by John Ousterhout. It's very good, and very applicable to me now that I'm working in a C# codebase. I wish a book like this existed earlier in my career. Will post a more in-depth review about it later.
- Started renting a [new studio space](https://nick.vanexan.ca/fragments/new-spaces) for work. Enjoying it so far.
- Started preparations for [Brew Tour 2024](https://nick.vanexan.ca/fragments/brew-tour-2024).
- My monthly [playlist for August 2024](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/381QlefGJktcHAVyfO8IYO?si=642e042582274461).

- I continued work on the modernization of a student loan application for a Canadian provincial government. The project is a .NET&nbsp;[Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)&nbsp;server application, so I've been continuing my journey in building UI in&nbsp;[C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/). I'm feeling a lot more productive in this tech stack this month.
- For some technical reasons I had to buy a Windows laptop for this contract this month. I purchased a [Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 11](https://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadx1/thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-11-\(14-inch-intel\)/len101t0049). I have feelings about being off of macOS, which I may publish in more detail later. But for now I am (1) happy with the development experience in Visual Studio for .NET;  and (2) appalled by the battery-to-performance ratio of Intel laptops.
- I turned 40. That fact plus my new Windows laptop has me feeling a bit like Richie from [The Bear](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/) post-[forks episode](https://variety.com/2023/tv/columns/the-bear-season-2-richie-episode-forks-1235651951/).

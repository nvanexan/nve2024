- Work: I continue work on the modernization of a student loan application for a Canadian provincial government. The project is a .NET&nbsp;[Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)&nbsp;server application, so I've been continuing my journey developing in&nbsp;[C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/).&nbsp;Enjoying it.
- Website: I added a new [Fragments](https://nick.vanexan.ca/fragments) and [Photos](https://nick.vanexan.ca/photos) section to my website.
- Lots of visits with friends and family.

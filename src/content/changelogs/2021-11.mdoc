- Still working with a crew at a leading Fintech mostly on [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) microservices and modernizing older Node services. Spent a fair bit of time writing Azure service bus integrations, cucumber bdd tests and Gatling performance tests.
- Reduced my privacy consulting work . I am still advising a couple of companies but Iâ€™m not taking on new work in this area at this time so I can focus more on engineering work.
- Rebuilt this personal site with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [mdx](https://mdxjs.com).
- Started thinking of things to build so that I can learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I might re-write my personal CLI (fw-cli).
- Started working with a physiotherapist to improve my back, and started working out more regularly again.
- Learned about [Project Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/), a new internet protocol between gopher and http.

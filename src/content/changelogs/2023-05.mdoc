- Continued work leading UI / feature development in a micro frontend for a publicly traded HR SaaS platform. 
- Implemented fun solutions with [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/) and [mock service worker](https://mswjs.io/).
- Interviewed a number of developers for my client and now assisting with onboarding of a new engineer.
- Caught up with old friends, including an old colleague from Serbia.
- Saw [Sasha Velour live at Meridian Hall](https://tolive.com/Event-Details-Page/reference/Sasha-Velour-2023).
- Finished learning how to play [Dust Filled Room](https://youtu.be/ctXJLM-Qms4) by [Steve Gunn](https://www.steve-gunn.com/).
- Explored minor pentatonic scales (C#, A and D#) for soloing and bending.
- Picked up a [Kobo e-reader](https://ca.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-clara-2e) to read library books a bit easier. It's made of recycled plastic that would otherwise be ocean-bound and is pretty awesome.
- These are [the songs that carried me through May](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4wAztQSMz1fhUVTIqmpjPN?si=552823e938ce463b).

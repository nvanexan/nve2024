- Continued work leading UI / feature development in a micro frontend for a publicly traded HR SaaS platform. 
- Started exploring [Keystatic](https://keystatic.com/) by [Thinkmill](https://www.thinkmill.com.au/) for a personal project. It's pretty cool tech and uses [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/), which I love, under the hood. May write about it in a longer post at some point.
- Also spent some time exploring the [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/) web components library. It's quite good.
- Learned how to play There Will Never Be Another You, another jazz standard, and had my last guitar lesson until the fall.
- Spent some time with my parents and extended family.
- Finished weeding and planting the front garden.
- These are [the songs that carried me through June](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/506bwaxNJVn6LWsuwbirK4?si=8f339d6d48a040ec).

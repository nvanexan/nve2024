- Continued microservice modernization work for a leading Fintech.
- Finished some UI and serverless API work for an old client, a local management consulting firm, on a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Prismic](https://prismic.io/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) stack. I'm more keen on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as a React framework and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for CI/CD these days, but it was fun to be working on the front-end again all the same.
- With Omicron present in our city, I stopped going to the gym. My back is not happy.
- Volunteered at a [UHN](https://www.uhn.ca/) vaccine clinic.
- Celebrated [George's](https://www.instagram.com/georgevancheung/) 7th birthday.

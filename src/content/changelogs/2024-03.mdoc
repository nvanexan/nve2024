- March was a very busy month at work. A couple of my colleagues were away for March break and so it was just me and another teammate holding down the fort a bit, so to speak. We had a lot of fun and still a great sprint demo.
- I learned this month that my current contract will be extended for another year. The project is a .NET [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) server application, which has me building UI in [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/), which has been a positive new learning experience for me. I'm feeling very grateful for the opportunity to get to work with this team. It's coming up soon on 10 years since I left law to go back to software development, and to be honest, every day I get to code for my paycheque still feels like a blessing and a win.
- This month marked my partner's 40th birthday. I and a couple of close friends planned a big surprise bash for her, with 65 of her closest friends and a bit of family gathered at [Boxcar Social Riverside](https://boxcarsocial.ca/pages/riverside) for a night of drinks, laughs and a bit of dancing. It was a great success and a very fun night.
- These are [the songs ](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5zzQPBMwjcDMFmtO0d63PN?si=36151bfed05d46d0)that we partied to, and that I listened to most in March.
- Those were the highlights, see you next month ✌️

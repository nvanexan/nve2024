- Continued UI / accessibility engineering work for a publicly traded provider of human resources software.
- Continued embedded privacy engineering support for a large SaaS client.
- Read through every decision on [GDPRHub](<https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=Category:Article_5(1)(e)_GDPR>) re Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR on data retention. **Noteworthy finding:** technical debt doesn't justify keeping personal data after it has served its use. 
- Updated my personal site to use [Markdoc](https://markdoc.io/) (Stripe's open source markdown authoring system) to render mainly flat HTML / CSS, and removed Next.JS / React. Wrote a few words about that and the perf results [here](https://nick.vanexan.ca/posts/markdoc).
- Made some tiny contributions to the [Markdoc library](https://github.com/markdoc/markdoc) itself.
- Barbecued for the first time this year. Jerk chicken wings!
- These are [the songs that carried me through May](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2udcAPL1SRZLjrJclqPvhu?si=80987d15832749d7).

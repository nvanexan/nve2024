- Continued work on the modernization of a student loan application for a Canadian provincial government. The project is a .NET&nbsp;[Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)&nbsp;server application, so I've been continuing my journey in building UI in&nbsp;[C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/).
- Finally watched [The Bear](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/). It's amazing. And so much more than I thought it would be. Ostensibly a kitchen drama. Actually a show about trauma and adult children of addicts / parents with mental health issues.
- Subluxated my shoulder in a cycling accident, attempting to avoid a car parked in the middle of the road.
- These are [the songs in my rotation in December](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0qEkM0AecEZ2yX4mrfjhCI?si=53d67275b5a048ea).

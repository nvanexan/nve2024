I started renting a studio space this month. I love WFH, don't get me wrong. And I don't want to commute to client offices. But it's nice to have a space in a less than 10 minute bike ride from my house to come and do work without the distractions of home. And it's nice to run into other humans navigating freelance life. Or so is my hypothesis. Will see how this experiment goes.

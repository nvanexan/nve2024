Hello, world! This is my first fragment. What's a fragment? It's a short piece of writing that doesn't merit a longer form article.

Why did I make a separate section of my site for fragments? Good question. I recently came across [@brandur's website](https://brandur.org/), and was inspired by their own atoms and fragments sections. Truth is… I'm a terrible blogger. Every now and then I'm inspired to write a longer form [article](https://nick.vanexan.ca/articles), usually about something technical. But often I lack time or energy for long-form writing. I still have a lot of notes, thoughts, musings, etc. that I often want to stash and share somewhere though. So my hope is by having a separate section for shorter-form snippets, I might write more, by writing less. And these fragments may help crystallize thoughts for a later longer form piece. Or they may just be like tweets. Either way, here we are.

I've decided to include fragments in my [RSS feed](https://nick.vanexan.ca/feed.xml), along with [articles](https://nick.vanexan.ca/articles) and [changelogs](https://nick.vanexan.ca/changelog). So you'll find them there. And here, of course. See you in the next one! ✌️

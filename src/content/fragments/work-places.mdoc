Most days I head to a coffee shop for a couple of hours of work. If I'm having trouble getting started on something, I might go earlier in the day. But usually I go in the afternoon after a productive morning. I'm an itinerant worker. I always have been. There is something important about the place I do work, for my energy, focus, etc. I like my home enough. And I don't miss the before times when I had to go to a client's office every day. Those offices were often the worst places to work productively. But I also don't love working from home all day, and I'm not sure how others do it. I find it unhealthy. My brain needs new environments to work from to do its best work. And I personally need to feel like I'm in a society, a part of it, colliding with it, to feel happy. It's why I live in a city (an expensive one!). Even if I am ultimately opening up a laptop and crawling into a focus zone. The irony. ðŸ˜‚

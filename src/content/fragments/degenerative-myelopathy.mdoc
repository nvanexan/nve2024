We recently learned our [George](https://www.instagram.com/georgevancheung/) has what appears to be the early stages of [Degenerative Myelopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_degenerative_myelopathy). It is a progressive disease of the spinal cord, a kind of canine ALS. It is not curable. And it puts his potential remaining time with us into sharp focus. We are going to try some physio therapy but overall the prognosis is we maybe have a year or so left with him. This is, of course, the contract with dogs. They age much faster than us. So we are trying to focus on the good times for the remaining time we have left. But this disease is [difficult to observe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezYqUJTbAL0). My heart is heavy.

title: The Figma MCP OAuth Gap in Cloud Agents
description: >-
  Figma's MCP server is transformative for local agentic development — but
  OAuth-only auth locks it out of cloud agents entirely.

Using the Figma MCP server locally with Claude Code is one of the best agentic development workflows I've found. The agent gets real design context — layout, tokens, component hierarchy — and produces faithful implementations on the first pass instead of making educated guesses.

So I wanted the same workflow in GitHub Copilot's cloud coding agent. That's when I hit a frustrating wall.

Figma's remote MCP server only supports OAuth — an interactive browser sign-in. Cloud agents run headless. No browser, no OAuth. The endpoint won't accept personal access tokens via headers either. It’s OAuth or nothing.

Third-party MCP servers that wrap the Figma REST API with PAT auth exist as workarounds, but they don't provide the same first-party design context. For the gap to close, either Figma needs to support PAT/API key auth on their MCP endpoint, or cloud agent runtimes need to support OAuth flows.

Both are actively requested. Neither is available today. The distance between what's possible locally and what's possible in the cloud shouldn't be this wide — especially for the protocol designed to bridge exactly this kind of tool integration. And especially when you’re paying a fair bit for a Figma license.

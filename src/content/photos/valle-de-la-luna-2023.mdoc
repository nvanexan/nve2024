I travelled to Chile in 2023. One of the sights we saw was the Valle de la Luna. El Valle de la Luna&nbsp;(*Valley of the Moon*) is located 13 kilometres (8&nbsp;mi) west of&nbsp;[San Pedro de Atacama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Pedro_de_Atacama), in the north of&nbsp;[Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile)&nbsp;in the&nbsp;[Cordillera de la Sal](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cordillera_de_la_Sal&action=edit&redlink=1), in the&nbsp;[Atacama desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_desert). It is a part of the&nbsp;[Reserva Nacional los Flamencos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserva_Nacional_los_Flamencos)&nbsp;and was declared a Nature Sanctuary in 1982 for its natural environment and strange lunar landscape, from which its name is derived. The Atacama desert is considered one of the driest places on earth, with some areas having not received a single drop of rain in hundreds of years.&nbsp;A prototype for a Mars rover was tested here by NASA because of the valley's dry and forbidding terrains. The Atacama is also the inspiration for Tattoine in the Mandalorian.

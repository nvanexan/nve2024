In 2023 I had the opportunity to visit Chile. We spent a few days in the Atacama Desert area. This photo was taken near Laguna Cejar in the [Salar de Atacama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salar_de_Atacama). The scenery is breathtaking here. Nearby is the [ALMA Observatory](https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/). It is the place where black holes were first observed only a few years ago and is one of the largest astronomical projects we as humans have undertaken on earth. The elevation at 5000m coupled with the fact thereâ€™s almost never clouds here makes this one of the best places on earth to observe the solar system, which is why it is here. Even with the naked eye, one can see all kinds of astronomical objects from here at night. It really is something to behold.

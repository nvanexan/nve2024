Heya 👋, I'm Nick.

I'm a software developer and data protection consultant. I've been making things for the web since the early 2000s, for myself and for clients ranging from high-growth startups to multinational SaaS providers. 

In terms of subject matter expertise, I am a Certified Information Privacy Professional (CIPP) for Canada and Europe and have deep practical experience building WCAG AA compliant UI for enterprise software applications.

Organizations I've had the pleasure of working with include:

In my free time, I like to spend time with my partner, Carmen, and our dog, George. I love running long distances, cycling around the city, and contributing to open source software.

Heya ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nick.

I'm a software developer and data protection consultant. I've been making things for the web for over 20 years, for myself and for clients ranging from high-growth startups to multinational SaaS providers. 

I am currently a consultant with [ObjectSharp (a Centrilogic company)](https://objectsharp.com/), where I help organizations design and develop modern web applications. My primary focus is on front-end web development and building design systems that deliver accessible and performant UI at scale. I also have experience building microservices (primarily for the Azure Cloud), containerizing applications, writing serverless functions and APIs, and building CLIs. 

In terms of subject matter expertise, I am a Certified Information Privacy Professional (CIPP) for Canada and Europe and have deep practical experience building WCAG AA compliant UI for enterprise software applications.

Organizations I've had the pleasure of working with include:

In my free time, I like to spend time with my partner, Carmen, and our dog, George. I love running long distances, learning to play the guitar, and contributing to open source software.

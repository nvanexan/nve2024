- Working on the modernization of a provincial government's student loan application and management system. Technology stack is .NET and [Blazor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-7.0), which means I'm writing UI mostly in [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) now. Moving from JS / TS ecosystem was a bit of a culture shock, but I'm finding the more I build with C# and .NET the more I like it. Blazor as a framework has a lot of shortcomings to surmount, but the DX of C# and .NET is quite nice.
